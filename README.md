# FMConverter
While compatability of FlagMaker1 flags with FlagMaker2 was a proposed feature, unfortunatly it didn't come along very well.
This simple site converts a FlagMaker1 flag to a flag compatable with FlagMaker2.

## Known Issues
* Thickness of palls will be different due to new system of determining the thickness.
* Transformers will be completely out of whack due to new system of determining positions.
